The folders inside this directory all correspond to tasks layed out by the assignment. 
The Task2 folder corresponds to the 0-1 dynamic problem and the Task3 folder corresponds
to the 0-N dynamic problem and so on. 

Readme files will be included for all programs inside each directory, but general layout is as follows: 

Each folder will contain a readme that details instructions for running all programs (all programs done in python) 
and will contain 1 or more *.csv files that contain results that were gathered when testing the progrmas. Some folders 
will have multiple csv files because multiple different types of test were run. Lastly, each folder will have *.py files
which are the programs used to generate the test results.
